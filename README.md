### About Me
I have loved programming since I was 10. I was introduced to it by my grandfather, and I have never stopped. There is something so satisfying about telling a machine to do something and then having it do it. I also love Mathematics and Science. I love being organized and doing things precisely (that's why I love programming and math).

I am taking this program because I want to get certified as a developer because I love it so much.
